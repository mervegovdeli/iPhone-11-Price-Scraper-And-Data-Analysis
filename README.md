ðŸ“± iPhone 11 Price Scraper and Data Analysis
This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts Apple iPhone 11 listings from eBay, gathers details like price, model, storage, RAM, and color, 
and performs data analysis & visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Automatically scrapes iPhone 11 listings from eBay.
âœ… Extracts key details such as price, model, color, storage capacity, and RAM.
âœ… Cleans and structures the collected data.
âœ… Performs statistical analysis on pricing trends.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Python
ðŸ”¹ Selenium â€“ For web scraping
ðŸ”¹ Pandas â€“ For data processing
ðŸ”¹ Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ For data visualization
ðŸ”¹ OpenPyXL â€“ For exporting to Excel

ðŸ“Š Data Analysis
Once the scraper runs, the collected data is saved in phoneinfo.xlsx.

During the analysis phase:
ðŸ“Œ Median, mode, standard deviation, and variance of prices are calculated.
ðŸ“Œ Capacity vs. Price trends are analyzed.
ðŸ“Œ Color-based price variations are examined.
ðŸ“Œ Data is visualized with box plots, bar charts, and pie charts.

ðŸ“Œ Sample Visualizations
ðŸ“Š Box Plot â€“ Price Distribution
(Shows how iPhone 11 prices are distributed.)

ðŸ“ˆ Regression Plot â€“ Capacity vs. Price
(Analyzes price changes based on storage capacity.)

ðŸ“Š Pie Chart â€“ Storage Capacity Distribution
(Displays the proportion of different storage options available.)
